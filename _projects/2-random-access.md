Novel research in implementing random access memory and logical gates into DNA complexes for stable computation. This Master's thesis studies how to introduce alternative pathways into molecular reactions in order to prevent entering off-target states. 

I gained experience writing Python C++ extensions to simplify programming interfaces.

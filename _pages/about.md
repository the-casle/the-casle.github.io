Currently, I'm a Research Assistant at the University of Minnesota. I'm working under Marc Riedel in the circuits and biology lab.

When I'm not in class or working on research I like to run. It's a good de-stressor and also gives my day some schedule.

Since I live in Minnesota, I like to take advantage of the snow in the winter and go snowboarding at my local hills. My brother lives in Colorado, and sometimes I'll visit him if I want to ride on something other than ice.

I also like to read books, some fantasy and some technical. The book I'm currently reading is *Effective Modern C++* by Scott Meyers. I would highly recommend his series on C++.
